										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I have been coding ever since I was 10. I first started off with very basic HTML. Then, as I became more interested, I started expanding my knowledge of the web-paging languages by taking online courses such as Codecademy. After playing around with projects in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I started to get into Python and immediately completed the Codecademy courses in these languages. I then became interested in Objective-C by watching YouTube videos about different projects and understanding its many classes and functionality one can use for the iOS apps. That was when we bought a textbook from Barnes and Nobles about Objective-C, which I finished it over winter break. Also in 7th grade, my academic advisor understood my excitement for programming. She and the CS teacher set up a class for the basics of Python to enable students to enter the intermediate Python class during high school and advance their programming knowledge. This immediately became my favorite class that year. I also attend Nano Hacker Academy, a non-profit mentoring program where student meet with their mentors once a week for ten weeks in a year to pursue their programming interests independently. They helped set me up to compete in different hackathons. Recently my favorite learning experience at Nano Hacker Academy is about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Through this I started to really understand Swift more by making an AI app for the WWDC scholarship submission. Over the last three years, since I was 12, I have created and submitted numerous apps. My first accepted app on the Apple App Store is called PaintPad. Currently I have 4 apps on the Apple App Store, 2 apps on Mac OSX, and 2 android apps on Google. Over the summer I created a jailbreak tool for ios 11 - 12.4 with Objective-C and C# for the Mac OS X.</p>
