											Hello Mr. and Ms. Mirza:<br>
                      I am the Director of Academic Technology at Trevor, and have had the honor of "teaching" Ozan -- but only in MiniTerm classes, unfortunately.  He took Beginning Programming in 8th grade (with Mr. Rencricca) and did well enough to skip my introductory class, moving directly into Intermediate Programming.  That is my loss!<br>
                      However, Ozan always keeps me informed of his progress.  When we were talking a few weeks ago, I told him I had a program that I wanted to convert so that it could run online (it is written in Java and needed to be converted to JavaScript).  The program is reasonably complicated so it wouldn't be a simple project, and I was considering having a Senior in Advanced Programming take this on.<br>
                      Ozan asked for a copy of the program so he could look at it.<br>
                      Within 2 weeks, Ozan was able to move it online!  This is a link to the online version that Ozan made:<br>
                      https://ozanmirza1.github.io/GOLrev_5_JS/<br>
                      I told him how amazing I thought this was, and wanted to make sure you knew as well.  He did all of this outside of class, while keeping up with his "official" responsibilities.  I can't overstate how impressed I am!<br>
                      Thank you,<br>
                      Stan Golanka</p>

											Ozan filled in for me when I had to miss a class.  He led the Intermediate Programming class in learning new material that will help them complete the Cryptography program they are working on.<br>
                      Ozan did such a good job that the students in the class asked me--unanimously--if he'd be able to teach another class.  I also understand that the students applauded when he finished.<br>
                      When I spoke to Ozan about this possibility, I had no doubt that Ozan completely understood the material. The "new" information here is that he is also a great teacher.  Students in that class are his peers (10th graders) or older (there are Juniors and Seniors as well).<br>
                      Those who teach understand how daunting it can be just to teach a class, let alone take over someone else's class in the middle of the year and teach some one else's curriculum.  Ozan was able to make it look easy.<br>
                      Great job, Ozan!</p>
